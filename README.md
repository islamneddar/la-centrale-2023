La central test : islam neddar

install deps : 
    ```
    yarn install
    ``` 

to run the test : 
    ```
    yarn run:code
    ```

to change values you can change the values in the file : src/data.json, where the code is running
on nodemon so every change will give a new result directly without restarting the code


i wanted to add tests to test the annonce services but i got some problems with mocks
so i stopped there
